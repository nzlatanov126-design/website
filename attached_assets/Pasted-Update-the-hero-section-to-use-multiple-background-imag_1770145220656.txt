Update the hero section to use multiple background images that rotate periodically instead of a single static image.

GOAL
Show different services visually by rotating high-quality images in the hero section, while keeping the text, layout, and CTAs stable.

REQUIREMENTS

1) HERO IMAGE SLIDER
- Replace the single hero background image with a background image slider.
- Use 4–5 images, each representing a different service:
  - Apartment renovation
  - Bathroom renovation
  - Kitchen renovation
  - Interior finishing works
  - Modern residential exterior
- Images should transition automatically every 5–7 seconds.
- Use smooth fade or crossfade transitions (no sliding animations).

2) TEXT & CTA BEHAVIOR
- Hero headline, subtext, and buttons must remain static and NOT move during image transitions.
- Text must stay readable at all times.

3) OVERLAY & READABILITY
- Apply a consistent dark gradient overlay on all hero images.
- Ensure text contrast is strong on every image.
- Overlay should be reused across slides for consistency.

4) RESPONSIVENESS
- Slider must work correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Images must scale properly (cover, center).
- No layout shift during transitions.

5) PERFORMANCE
- Optimize images for web use.
- Lazy-load non-initial images if possible.
- Do not block page load.

6) ACCESSIBILITY & UX
- No autoplay controls visible (clean hero).
- No rapid flashing or distracting effects.
- Ensure no horizontal scroll or overflow.

7) IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Use existing framework/components in the project.
- If using React, keep the logic clean and reusable.
- Avoid external heavy slider libraries unless already present.
- Keep code maintainable and simple.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Hero cycles through multiple service images automatically.
- Text and buttons remain stable.
- Smooth fade transitions.
- Fully responsive.
- No console errors.

After implementation:
- List the images used
- Explain how to replace or add new hero images later
