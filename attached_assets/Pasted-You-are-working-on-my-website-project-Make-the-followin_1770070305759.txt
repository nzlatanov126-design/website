You are working on my website project. Make the following changes:

GOAL 1 — Navbar links must each have a real page
1) Review the Navbar component and list every nav button/link currently shown.
2) For EVERY navbar item, ensure it navigates to its own route (page) and that the route exists.
3) Create missing pages/routes for all navbar buttons so that no navbar link is a dead link.
4) Each page must contain full, real content (not just a title). Add a complete page layout with:
   - Hero section (headline + short subtext + primary CTA button)
   - 2–4 relevant content sections (cards/columns, features, steps, etc.)
   - A call-to-action section near the bottom
   - Footer remains consistent

Use the existing site styling/components. Keep design consistent and modern (minimal, premium).

GOAL 2 — “Get a Quote” must go to a Quote page with a service dropdown form
1) Create a dedicated page/route called /quote (or /get-a-quote if you prefer, but update navbar accordingly).
2) The Quote page should look like a contact/lead page:
   - Left column: headline “Започнете проекта си днес”, short paragraph, contact info blocks (Phone, Office, Working hours).
   - Right column: a form titled “Получете безплатна оферта”.
3) The form must include these fields:
   - Full Name (required)
   - Email (required, validate email)
   - Object Location (required)
   - Service (REQUIRED dropdown/select)
   - Project Details (textarea, required)
   - Submit button
4) The service dropdown options must be:
   - Цялостен ремонт (Turnkey renovation)
   - Ремонт на баня
   - Боядисване и шпакловка
   - Подови настилки / плочки
   - Гипсокартон / окачени тавани
   - Довършителни работи
   - Търговски обекти
   - Друго
5) On submit, show a success message on the page (no external email service required). If you already have backend handling, keep it.

TECH NOTES
- The project uses (detect automatically) the current routing setup and implement pages accordingly:
  - If using Wouter: add <Route> entries.
  - If using React Router: add routes in the router config.
- Ensure navbar links use the correct Link component (wouter or react-router) consistently.
- Ensure active route navigation works and no console errors are introduced.
- Keep all text content in Bulgarian.
- Do not remove existing components; refactor safely.

DELIVERABLES / ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Clicking every navbar item opens a real page with full content.
- “Get a Quote” opens /quote with the form and service dropdown.
- Form validates required fields and shows a success state after submit.
- Site builds without errors.

After making changes, output:
1) A short summary of what you changed
2) The list of created/edited files
3) How to test each route quickly
