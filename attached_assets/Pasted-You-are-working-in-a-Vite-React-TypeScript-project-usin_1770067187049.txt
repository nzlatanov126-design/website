You are working in a Vite + React + TypeScript project using Wouter for routing (Link is imported from "wouter" in Navbar). The site is for a renovation company. Create new pages for all dropdown items in the Navbar and apply the UX/design fixes listed below. Do not break the build.

Rules

Frontend only. Do not modify server code.

Use TailwindCSS only.

Keep components clean and reusable.

Keep existing design style consistent (premium, neutral, renovation company vibe).

Use semantic HTML and good SEO (title headings, meta-like structure in the page content).

All pages must be responsive.

Keep framer-motion where it already exists; no heavy animations.

1) Routing: create real pages for dropdown items
Create these routes/pages:
Services pages (create folder client/src/pages/services/)

/services/painting → Painting.tsx

/services/plaster-putty → PlasterPutty.tsx

/services/tiles → Tiles.tsx

/services/electrical → Electrical.tsx

/services/plumbing → Plumbing.tsx

/services/drywall → Drywall.tsx

/services/flooring → Flooring.tsx

Renovation category pages (create folder client/src/pages/projects/)

/projects/bathroom-renovation → BathroomRenovation.tsx

/projects/kitchen-renovation → KitchenRenovation.tsx

/projects/bedroom-renovation → BedroomRenovation.tsx

/projects/office-renovation → OfficeRenovation.tsx

Each new page must include:

Navbar at top and Footer at bottom (reuse existing components).

A hero section with title + short subtext + CTA button linking to /#quote or / with #quote behavior (see routing notes).

“What’s included” bullet list

“Process” section (3–5 steps)

“Pricing guidance” section (simple, non-binding, explains that final quote requires site visit)

FAQ (3–5 items relevant to that service)

Final CTA section to request a quote (button links to quote form on Home page)

2) Update App routing (Wouter)

Edit client/src/App.tsx (or wherever routes are defined) to add routes for all new pages listed above.

Ensure:

/ renders the existing Home page.

New routes render new pages.

Unknown routes show a simple NotFound page (optional).

3) Navbar fixes + improvements

Edit client/src/components/Navbar.tsx:

(a) Link dropdown items to the new pages

Replace dropdown hrefs so they navigate to the new routes above, e.g.

Painting → /services/painting

Bathroom Renovation → /projects/bathroom-renovation

(b) Mobile dropdowns must be collapsible

Currently mobile dropdowns are always expanded. Add state so:

Tapping “Services” expands/collapses its items

Tapping “Apartments & Houses” expands/collapses its items

Other links close the mobile menu immediately
Keep it simple and reliable.

(c) Rounded corners polish

Replace sharp corners:

dropdown menu container: rounded-sm → rounded-2xl

CTA button: rounded-sm → rounded-full (or rounded-xl)

mobile panel cards: make consistent rounded-xl/2xl
Keep the rest of the look the same.

(d) Make top info bar email + phone clickable

Email: mailto link

Phone: tel link

4) Home page anchor corrections

Edit the Home page file that contains your landing page sections (it currently exports export default function Home() and includes <Navbar /> and <Footer />).

Required changes:

Change FAQ “Ask a Question” button link to go to #quote (it currently points to #contact).

Move id="testimonials" to the testimonials SECTION element so scrolling lands correctly.

Optional polish: replace excessive rounded-sm on big cards with rounded-2xl.

Do NOT change the overall section order or remove content.

5) Make “Request a Quote” work from other pages

Because quote form is on Home page (route /), ensure quote CTAs on service pages navigate correctly.

Implementation guidance:

The CTA button should link to "/#quote" (not just #quote) to ensure it works even from other routes.
