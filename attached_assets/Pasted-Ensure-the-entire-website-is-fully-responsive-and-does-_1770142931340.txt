Ensure the entire website is fully responsive and does NOT break when resizing the browser window (fullscreen → small window) or when opened on mobile/tablet.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Responsive Layout
- Use Flexbox/Grid for all layouts (no fixed pixel layouts for main sections).
- All sections must adapt smoothly from large desktop to small screens.
- No horizontal scrolling at any screen size.
- No content overlapping, clipping, or elements going off-screen.

2) Breakpoints
Implement and verify responsive behavior at these widths:
- 1440px (desktop)
- 1024px (laptop/tablet landscape)
- 768px (tablet)
- 480px (mobile)
- 375px (small mobile)

3) Navbar Responsiveness
- Desktop: normal horizontal navbar.
- Tablet/mobile: switch to hamburger menu.
- Menu must open/close properly and not overflow.
- Logo stays correctly sized and aligned (no whitespace or stretching).
- All buttons remain clickable and readable.

4) Images & Media
- All images must be responsive: max-width: 100%, height: auto.
- Use object-fit (cover/contain) where appropriate.
- No image should cause layout overflow or push content outside containers.

5) Typography & Spacing
- Use responsive font sizes (rem/clamp) so headings don’t overflow.
- Ensure consistent padding/margins that scale down on mobile.
- Buttons must remain large enough to tap on mobile.

6) Forms (Quote / Footer Contact)
- Inputs must fit on small screens.
- Form should stack vertically on mobile.
- No cut-off fields or broken alignment.

7) Quality Check (must do)
- Add or run a quick responsive test by checking these widths in the browser.
- Fix any issues found: overflow-x, misalignment, wrapping, spacing, menu, images.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Resizing the window from fullscreen to a small width does not break any layout.
- On mobile, all sections stack cleanly and remain readable.
- No horizontal scroll on any page.
- Navbar + hamburger works perfectly on mobile.
- No console errors.

After implementing, output:
- What was changed to improve responsiveness
- Which files were modified
- A short checklist of how to test responsiveness (steps + widths)
